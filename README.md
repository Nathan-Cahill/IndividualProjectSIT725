# IndividualProjectSIT725

The following project is a task created by Nathan Cahill to pass the subject SIT725. It is a compilation of tasks from weeks 1-7 from the key practicals throughout the semester.
This idea has been developed from a feature I was asked to add into a website I created for my girlfriends dads business.

# PlannersUnite

Planners unite is a chat room that helps local town planners get in contact with clients, architects and other planners using a live messaging platform.

# How to run

npm i and npm start should (hopefully) start the chat room for you to use. For a better experience open 2 tabs and use different names to message between two users.
